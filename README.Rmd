The goal of the Riparian Critical Habitat Tool (RiTCH) is to provide quantitative evidence to support the delineation of riparian Critical Habitat. The tool provides an interface for a searchable database containing the current state of knowledge regarding the relationships between the riparian zone (attributes and processes), aquatic features, and aquatic species at risk.

## Disclaimer
This App is a work in progress. It is being used to test UI, UX, and 
Deployment. In its current form, it has limited functionality. Some features have limited or no implementation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RiTCH from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dfrancis01/dfo-ritch-project")
```
<!--
You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
